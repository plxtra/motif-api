# Overview

The Motif API allows you to add extensions to the [Motif Web Application](/architecture/functionalities/motif/).  These extensions can access services and data within Motif and add new features and capabilities.  This includes adding new top level windows and adding items to the menu.

The charting within Motif is implemented as an extension.  Motif also ships with an example `TsDemo` extension.  A [guide](../guide/index.md) steps you through creating this `TsDemo` extension.
